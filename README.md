# Currency Game [BETA]
A currently text-based game. A pretty old personal project I haven't updated for a while, but it's definitely not finalized.
The program is copied over from replit, so some functionality might be wonky if you try to run it elsewhere. The save file might need to be generated before it can function.

The game is prompt based. After creating an account in the game, type "help" for more commands.

Version Info (if I can figure out how to work GitHub?):
v3.7.1 is the oldest version. I'm not gonna lie I have no idea what is going on in here, but it definitely should have the most functionality with the worst aesthetics.
v3.9 and v4.0 both have much less functionality, but have better looking aesthetic than v3.7.1
